## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is WP-Stripe?
WP-Stripe is a library bringing in Stripe functionality to WordPress, including certain plugins. The goal, however, is to create a library that is installed as a standalone package so that if you need to use Stripe in other areas of your site, you don't need to have several different Stripe libraries.

### What will the first stable version include?
It will include credit card processing and usage of either Checkout.js (Stripe's pre-designed checkout library) or Stripe.js (a custom designed checkout library).

### Will Apple Pay/Bitcoin/eChecks/Alipay be integrated?
Yes. The goal is to make the entire Stripe stack integrated into WordPress for use by the user or other plugins?
